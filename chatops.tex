\subsubsection{Chat Ops}

DM-SQuaRE is using a Slack chatbot called ``sqrbot'' to make some tasks
easier. Currently it performs a range of functions, from returning the
status of various infrastructure machines to creating technotes to
monitoring whether metrics in our processing stack have changed between
CI builds. What these tasks have in common is that they were frequently
requested actions that required someone being asked for help and having
to interrupt their own work to perform a task. With sqrbot, the
requestor can simply ask sqrbot in a Slack channel for the information
(or creation of a technote skeleton, etc.) and get immediate gratification.

The basic architecture is simple: sqrbot is simply a collection of hubot
scripts running as a Slack bot, which in turn drive microservices,
written in Python and implemented using the Flask framework.  These
microservices have an API that responds with JSON, so the job of sqrbot
is simply to accept commands, create appropriate HTTP transactions, and
then reformat the output into a conversational format.  The whole
assembly runs in a Kubernetes cluster.
