\subsection{Case Study: Deploying Qserv}

Docker etc.

Distributed service application; multiple flavors of containers for various parts of the service are built by
CI.
TravisCI uses containers to run multi-node integration test suite on each branch commit and PR.
Container deployment to bare-metal clusters is currently done with ad-hoc scripting, but we are moving to k8s.
Discussion of some development and testing leverage we are looking to get from k8s.
